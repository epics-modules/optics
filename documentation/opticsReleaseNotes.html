	(orientation matrix) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Added some documentation for
	slits, mirrors, filters, spherical grating monochromator,
	high-energy-resolution monochromator. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Ported xia slit to EPICS 3.14, and improved its behavior when
	driven by ca_put_callback().

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-4</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Added table of fixed points
	(points about which an optical table rotates) to table database,
	request file, and medm displays 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The save_restore include file, table_settings.req, now
	requires the additional macro argument 'Q'. This is the same macro
	argument required by table.db.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-3</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>This is the first release of the synApps optics module.
Version numbering for this module begins with 2.3 because this module
was split from version 2.2 of the std module, and I wanted to retain
the CVS histories of module contents.</P>
<P>This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.5, mpf
2.4.2, and std 2.3. Differences from software as previously released
in std 2.2:

	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">kohzuSeq.db - added debug PV
	$(P)KohzuCtlDebug. Fixed long-standing bug: if the theta motor was
	moved by a very small amount (by external client not working through
	kohzuCtl) this software would sometimes ignore the notification it
	received from EPICS.

	<LI><P>hrSeq.db - added debug PV $(P)HR$(N)CtlDebug. Fixed
	long-standing bug: if a theta motor was moved by a very small amount
