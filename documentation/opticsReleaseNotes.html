<h1 align="center">optics Release Notes</h1>

<h2 align="center">Release 2-5</h2>
Added diffractometer support (orientation matrix)

Added some documentation for slits, mirrors, filters, spherical grating
monochromator, high-energy-resolution monochromator.

Ported xia slit to EPICS 3.14, and improved its behavior when driven by
ca_put_callback().

<h2 align="center">Release 2-4</h2>
Added table of fixed points (points about which an optical table rotates) to table database,
request file, and medm displays

<P>The save_restore include file, table_settings.req, now requires the additional macro argument 'Q'.  This is
the same macro argument required by table.db.

<h2 align="center">Release 2-3</h2>

<p align="left">This is the first release of the synApps optics module.
Version numbering for this module begins with 2.3 because this module
was split from version 2.2 of the std module, and I wanted to retain
the CVS histories of module contents.</p>

This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.5, mpf 2.4.2, and std 2.3.

Differences from software as previously released in std 2.2:
<ul>
<li>Converted to EPICS 3.14
<li>Docs updated and moved to optics/documentation
<li>SGM.db - removed forward links pointing nowhere (gdct artifacts).
<li>kohzuSeq.db - added debug PV $(P)KohzuCtlDebug.  Fixed long-standing bug:
if the theta motor was moved by a very small amount (by external client
not working through kohzuCtl) this software would sometimes ignore the
notification it received from EPICS.
<li>hrSeq.db - added debug PV $(P)HR$(N)CtlDebug. Fixed long-standing bug:
if a theta motor was moved by a very small amount (by external client
not working through hrCtl) this software would sometimes ignore the
notification it received from EPICS.
</ul>
