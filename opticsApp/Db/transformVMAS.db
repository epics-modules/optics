# This database implements the transformation necessary for variable
# mask aperture slits
#
# The horizontal and vertical slit sizes are each controlled by a single
# motor (yaw and pitch, respectively)

#
# size = $(P)$(VMAS)C1 - $(P)$(VMAS)C2 * $(P)$(M1DRV) 
# 
# Where:
#	$(P)$(VMAS)C1 = horizontal aperture size when mask angle is 0 degrees
#	$(P)$(VMAS)C2 = ratio of edge separation to motor lever arm 

#
# These two records are where the soft motors write their output.
# They are needed because writing to a transform record field does not
# cause the record to process?
# We use forward links to the transform record (rather than making the INPA
# field of the transform record CP) so that the scan record waits 
# for the motors to move.
